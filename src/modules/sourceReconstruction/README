README - SourceReconstruction

* SourceReconstruction needs Eigen v3.1 or higher due to sparse matrix support
* Ubuntu 12.04 contains Eigen v3.0.5
* mixed setup causes compiler errors

Solution:
* download latest version >= 3.1 from http://eigen.tuxfamily.org
* extract it to eigen<version> e.g. eigen311
* delete all files and folders, except: Eigen, unsupported and signature_of_eigen3_matrix_library
* delete all CMakeLists.txt files:
** cd <eigen directory>
** find . -iname CMakeLists.txt
** rm <CMakeLists locations> (use gedit to replace "./" by "" and "\n" by " ")
* move eigen directory to global or user space e.g. /opt/include/ or ~/include/
* recommended file hierarchy e.g.:
	/opt/include/eigen311
	/opt/include/eigen311/Eigen
	/opt/include/eigen311/unsupported
	/opt/include/eigen311/signature_of_eigen3_matrix_library
* tell CMake of OpenWalnut to use custom Eigen files instead of system Eigen files:
** set environment variable to specify location of Eigen
** temporary: export EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR="<eigen directory>"
** temporary example: export EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR="/opt/include/eigen311"
** User: echo EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR="<eigen directory>" >> ~/.pam_environment
** User example: echo EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR="/opt/include/eigen311" >> ~/.pam_environment
** Global: echo EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR="<eigen directory>" >> /etc/environment
** Global example: echo EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR="/opt/include/eigen311" >> /etc/environment
